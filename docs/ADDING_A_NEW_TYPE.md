# Adding a new type

Types are the first level of the registry. They are the group of types that are related to each other.
For now we have only one type `functions`. i.e. javascript utility functions.
In future we may add more types like `react-hooks`, etc

1. Create a folder in `registry/` with the name of the type in `kebab-case`.
2. Add at least one category in the type.
3. Add at least one method in the category.
