# Adding a new category

Categories are the second level of the registry. They are the group of methods that are related to each other.

1. Create a folder in `registry/<type>/` with the name of the category in `kebab-case`.
2. Add at least one method in the category.

_See how to add a new method [here](ADDING_A_NEW_METHOD.md)_
