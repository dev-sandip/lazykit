desc: Shuffles the elements of an array.
---

The shuffleArr function is a utility function in JavaScript that takes
an array and shuffles it. The function uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm
to shuffle the array. The Fisher-Yates algorithm is an efficient
algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence. The
function returns a new array with the elements of the original array
shuffled.

The shuffleArr function does not modify the original array, it returns a
new array with the elements shuffled.
